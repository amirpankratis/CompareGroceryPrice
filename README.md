# What Compare grocery price application would be in the future?

Compare grocery price application would be very better when we can use the advantage of the internet and many users, if users would always update each store's prices and always price would be updated in the main server, other users can get their nearest price of grocery and they won't need to be there to see price and compare. also, the list would be a much more complete product list for anyone to use and would fix a larger scale of the problem for people in the world.
